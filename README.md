# Bootstrap-Portfolio (Bootcamp Challenge 3)

## Description 
This javascript program processes a list of financial data from a company, including the month and the profit or loss for that month. It then calculates statistics including total number of months, net total profit and loss, average change in profit or loss, greatest increase and decrease in profit, in addition to the dates at which these occured. 

### How to use this program

* Go to the website page, this will be blank, and access the console through the developer tools of your browser.
